      <!-- Niagara Falls Story (~300 words) -->

        <h3>Niagara Falls</h3>
        <p class="story-intro"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Niagara Falls is the kind of destination you dream about as a child and find even more impressive as an adult. My first trip there was unforgettable, but it’s returning over the years that truly deepened my appreciation. Every visit reveals something new—a different angle of the falls, another beautiful rainbow, or a hidden spot along the river.</p>

          <div class="readmore-content">
            <p><strong>Experience:</strong> I started my day early, walking to the falls before the rush of tourists. The air was cool and thick with mist; standing near the edge, the roar of water made everything else seem quiet. The famous boat tour was the highlight—donning a rain poncho, feeling the spray on my skin, and laughing with strangers as we all failed to stay dry! Later I explored Clifton Hill, indulging in local fudge and visiting quirky museums, from wax figures to mini golf. In the evening, I watched the falls light up with colored illuminations and joined a lively crowd snapping photos. One small hike led me to quieter views and peaceful trails, perfect for reflecting on the day’s adventure.</p>
            <p><strong>Review & Tips:</strong> Niagara Falls brings together nature, culture, and excitement. The crowds can be tough, especially in summer or on weekends, so plan for off-hours or weekdays. Waterproof clothing is a must for the boat tour! If you’re a foodie, try the local poutine or fudge—Canadian classics. Most importantly, take time to explore the quieter nearby parks for a breath of calm. Each visit has given me both thrill and peace—Niagara Falls always has something to offer.</p>

      <!-- CN Tower Story (~300 words) -->
      <div class="story-card">
        <img src="tower.png" alt="Toronto CN Tower" class="story-img" />
        <h3>Toronto CN Tower</h3>
        <p class="story-intro"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Toronto’s CN Tower is a landmark that defines the city skyline, but it’s so much more when experienced up close. I’ve always loved high places and big city energy, so this adventure was right up my alley. The first glimpse of the tower from street level is already impressive, but inside, every step upward adds to the anticipation.</p>
        <details>
          <summary class="readmore-toggle">Show Story <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></summary>
          <div class="readmore-content">
            <p><strong>Experience:</strong> Riding the glass-walled elevator, I felt my heart speed up as the city shrank below. At the top, stepping onto the glass floor was a mix of fear and excitement—I took a couple of hesitant steps, then realized how much fun it was! The SkyPod offers stunning 360° city views, and I could see landmarks for miles, with sunset making everything golden. I spent time at the interactive exhibits, learning about Toronto’s history and the tower’s engineering, which gave me a new appreciation for its construction. After admiring the scenery, I grabbed a coffee at the café and watched the skyline shift from daylight to sparkling city lights.</p>
            <p><strong>Review & Tips:</strong> The CN Tower is an absolute must for visitors and locals alike. Buy tickets online for convenience and aim for late afternoon if you want both sunlight and nighttime views. Try the SkyPod deck if you like a quiet, more reflective experience, or the EdgeWalk if you’re brave and want a real thrill. Even just relaxing with a snack in the café, overlooking the world below, makes for a memorable day. Every visit makes Toronto feel big, bold, and alive.</p>

      <!-- Blue Mountain Story (~300 words) -->
      <div class="story-card">

        <h3>Blue Mountain, Toronto</h3>
        <p class="story-intro"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Blue Mountain has become my go-to recommendation for anyone seeking both adventure and relaxation near Toronto. Whether it’s snow or sunshine, this resort area is buzzing with excitement and natural beauty. Each season brings new activities and fresh perspectives on the landscape.</p>
        <details>
          <summary class="readmore-toggle">Show Story <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></summary>
          <div class="readmore-content">
            <p><strong>Experience:</strong> My visit to Blue Mountain began on the hiking trails, winding through forests and open vistas with mountain views stretching for miles. In winter, the ski runs are lively and energetic, with plenty of beginners and pros enjoying the snow. I loved exploring the village—charming shops, bustling restaurants, and live music on outdoor patios. The gondola ride was a highlight, providing breathtaking aerial views of the resort and beyond. In summer months, festivals and street performances add to the friendly, open atmosphere. I even joined a spontaneous game of beach volleyball near the lake!</p>
            <p><strong>Review & Tips:</strong> Blue Mountain is best experienced over a couple of days in different seasons. Book activities or spa sessions in advance, as they fill up fast, especially during holidays. The local restaurants are wonderful for fresh, hearty meals. If you’re looking for calm, find a quiet spot around sunset and simply take in the view. Friendly locals and a safe, welcoming environment make it ideal for solo travelers, families, or friend groups. It’s the mix of energy and tranquility that keeps me coming back every year.</p>
